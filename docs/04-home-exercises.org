** Golang challenge: Simplify app binding via svcat

We've used =PodPreset= to map secrets generated from Bind to destination pod.
Write a [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/][kubectl like plugin]] for [[https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/tree/master/cmd/svcat][svcat]]

** Ansible challenge:

Write single task in role =my-pg-apb= that will take care of both provisioning and deprovisioning of resources.
Reward is that you won't need to keep separate list of resources to be deleted and created.
